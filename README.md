# To-Do-list

A cosy pixel-art inspired To-do list website with custom animations and gifs. 
Its not just a productivity tool - its your won little tiny world where a bird flies across the screen and bunnies hop around in the meadows while you get your things done. 

## Features
- Add, Complete, Delete and Recover tasks.
- Animated bird GIF flying across the top of the screen every now and then
- A white and a brown bunny hopping around at the bottom of the screen in the meadows.
- Mobile-friendly design.

## Extra info
- Made in Github codespaces because I dont have access to VSCode
- Animation of Bird was handmade by me
- Asked github AI for help with debugging and more complex code for the animations

## Future Plans
- Gamification - plan on adding XP, badges and other elements to make it feel fun to complete tasks
- Sound effects and screen effects when tasks are completed
- Customization options for various elements to make it feel like your own
- Sign in/Sign up options to help store your to do list and customize a lot more.

### Made with â™¥, JavaScript, and way too much coffee.
